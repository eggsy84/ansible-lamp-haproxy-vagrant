ansible-lamp-haproxy-vagrant
============================

A fork of the Ansible Lamp HA Proxy. Only different is the inclusion of a Vagrantfile to spin up environment

For ease of use it will require the Vagrant Hosts plugin to be installed:

vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater

(More info on Vagrant hosts manager: https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater)
